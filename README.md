# MovieMate â€” Built with Lynx

**MovieMate** is a blazing-fast **movie recommendation engine** built using **Lynx**, the brand-new open-source cross-platform framework from ByteDance. MovieMate helps you find movies youâ€™ll love, with filters for genre, year, and ratings â€” all wrapped in a cutting-edge, **truly native** UI experience powered by Lynx's revolutionary dual-threaded architecture.

## Why Lynx?

Lynx launched publicly on **March 5th, 2025** (yesterday as of the creation of this app), and aims to redefine how developers create cross-platform apps. Unlike React Native, Lynx **removes the traditional bridge entirely**, using **Preact under the hood** and introducing **Rspeedy**, a Rust-based toolchain, for lightning-fast builds. It supports **ReactLynx** for a familiar component-driven workflow, but with direct access to **native UI primitives**.

Key Advantages:
- Multi-threaded architecture â€” UI is always buttery smooth.
- First-class support for **both iOS and Android** from the start.
- **Instant First Frame Rendering (IFR)** for faster app startup.
- Rust-powered builds via **Rspeedy**, as fast as (or faster than) Vite.
- Full CSS support, including modern effects like **masking, gradients, and animations**.
- Ships with **Lynx Devtool**, a powerful inspector for UI hierarchy and styles.
- Designed to match native performance at scale, already powering parts of TikTok.

## Target Platforms

MovieMate is currently developed and tested on **iOS** using **Xcode Simulator**, but thanks to Lynxâ€™s **native-first design**, the app can be deployed to both **Android** and **iOS** with minimal effort.

## Why Lynx Stood Out

I chose Lynx because it directly addresses some of **React Native's long-standing performance pain points**:

âœ… **No More Bridge Bottleneck** â€” Lynx directly manages the rendering pipeline.  
âœ… **Multi-Threaded by Design** â€” Business logic offloaded to a background thread.  
âœ… **Instant First Frame Rendering** â€” Perceived instant startup without white flashes.  
âœ… **Main Thread Scripting (MTS)** â€” Priority gestures/events always handled smoothly.

## Architecture Challenges

Using Lynx early came with its learning curve. Some key challenges:

ðŸ”´ Limited debugging â€” Syntax errors would crash the app in Explorer with no clear logs.  
ðŸ”´ Sparse documentation â€” I relied heavily on reading source code and internal examples since there isn't much of an ecosystem yet.  
ðŸ”´ Strict thread separation â€” Lynx splits work between a **main thread** (UI updates) and a **background thread** (logic & effects) so strict rules have to be followed when working with Lynx.

## Future Plans

Upcoming features could include:

- User Accounts & Favorites
- Improved recommendation algorithm
- Expanded Filtering (Language, Runtime, etc.)  
- Animated Transitions using Lynx CSS capabilities
